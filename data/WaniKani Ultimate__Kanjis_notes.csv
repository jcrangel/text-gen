It's weird, because it's above the ground, not where toes belong.","Focus your imagination on how body parts should be buried, not above ground like this. Sure, finding a toe is a little strange, but finding a toe above the ground? Downright silly.","Of course when you find a toe above the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, Jourm (???).","Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is ???. He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) ??. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the ??? reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently.",27,kanji level1
?,"Below, Down, Under, Beneath","?, ?","??, ?, ??, ?","?, ?",-,"ground, toe",,There's a toe below ground.,"So, where is the toe now? It's below ground. Imagine yourself digging it out, and thinking... ugh, why does it have to be below ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?","You keep digging for the toe below the ground, and instead of hitting a toe you hit something hard and metallic. You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a car (?). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.","There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is ?, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read ? as ?.

?,"Big, Large","??, ??",??,?,-,big,,The big radical and the big kanji are exactly the same!,"So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of this kanji as well.","There's this big guy (that's how you remember the radical, remember?), and he's wearing a huge Tie Dye (??, ??) shirt. Because he's so huge, the tie dye shirt is also super huge. Everything about him is pretty big, but the tie dye stands out more than anything.","When you look at the big guy in your head, imagine him covered in tie dye head to toe. Think about how ridiculous it looks on him, especially since he's such a big guy. Shirt. Sweatpants. Hat. Shoes... it goes on and on.",29,kanji level1
?,"Construction, Industry","??, ?",-,?,-,construction,,"The construction radical and the construction kanji are the same! This kanji also means industry, which is what construction is, if you think about it. It's all part of the construction industry.",Know your radicals and you'll know this kanji's meaning.,"For kanji that use the ?? (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character ???? every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see ??, think ????. You see some construction in front of you. There, standing shirtless (only a suspender and hard hat) is (????), looking back at you.","If ???? as a construction worker standing in a construction site some how doesn't make your legs tremble, that's okay and totally normal. Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that? Alternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of ????'s actual face, though). You and ???? make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it. Hint: When you see ? in a kanji it will often take the ?? reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!",30,level1 kanji
?,Eight,??,"?, ??",?,-,fins,,"This isn't exactly the same as the fins radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly ""modified radical"" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? Eight fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.","Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think ""Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?"" Yes, you do.","After you count and smell all eight of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large hatch (??) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.","You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer.

?,Mouth,"??, ?",??,?,-,mouth,,The mouth radical and the mouth kanji are exactly the same!,If you learned your radicals–which the WaniKani system forces you to do (unless you're cheating)–you'll already know the meaning of the kanji.,You can't get that mouth out of your mind. Remember seeing the construction worker ???? earlier in the ? mnemonic? You can't forget construction worker ????'s mouth.,You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a cool mouth ???? has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?,34,level1 kanji
?,Nine,"?, ???",???,?,-,nine,,"Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is nine and the kanji is nine, making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.","If you know your radicals well, this kanji will be a breeze!","Although this kanji has two on'yomi to learn, the pronunciations of those two on'yomi are very similar, so that should make them easier to remember. When you were nine your favorite foods were cookies (?) and cucumbers (???). Yum yum!","Picture nine-year-old you, lining up nine cookies and nine cucumbers. You dip a cookie in milk and bite into it, then dip a cucumber in and take a bite. Nine bites each until they're all gone. Ah, you miss being nine.",35,level1 kanji
?,One,"??, ??",??,?,-,ground,,"Lying on the ground is something that looks just like the ground, the number One. Why is this One lying down? It's been shot by the number two. It's lying there, bleeding out and dying. The number One doesn't have long to live.","To remember the meaning of One, imagine yourself there at the scene of the crime. You grab One in your arms, trying to prop it up, trying to hear its last words. Instead, it just splatters some blood on your face. ""Who did this to you?"" you ask. The number One points weakly, and you see number Two running off into an alleyway. He's always been jealous of number One and knows he can be number one now that he's taken the real number one out.","As you're sitting there next to One, holding him up, you start feeling a weird sensation all over your skin. From the wound comes a fine powder (obviously coming from the special bullet used to kill One) that causes the person it touches to get extremely itchy (??).","Make sure you feel the ridiculously itchy sensation covering your body. It climbs from your hands, where you're holding the number One up, and then goes through your arms, crawls up your neck, goes down your body, and then covers everything. It becomes uncontrollable, and you're scratching everywhere, writhing on the ground. It's so itchy that it's the most painful thing you've ever experienced (you should imagine this vividly, so you remember the reading of this kanji).",36,kanji level1

Well this is a person too!,"Know the radicals, and you shall know the kanji.","Only one person at Nintendo (??) complained about the new Jeans (??) policy, and that person was you.","Imagine how angry you were about the policy. You'll have to come up with something to be angry about yourself (pick something that would actually make you angry, like maybe you're only allowed to wear cut off short-shorts jeans at Nintendo now), but if you pick something good, you'll definitely remember the two readings for this. Just remember you're working at Nintendo, and the policy has to be something about jeans.

Monster.","Know anyone named Ricky (??), even a famous person like Ricky Ricardo or Ricky Gervais? Put his face on the monster the Power Rangers are fighting.

?,Seven,??,"??, ??",?,-,seven,,"Lucky for you (as is the case with many of the lower-stroke kanji), this kanji is the same as the radical you've already learned.

So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.",Make sure you know your radicals well and you'll be A-Okay on this one!,"You know this kanji means Seven, so let's use that to remember the reading too.

Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the ""she"" part in she cheated (??). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously.",40,kanji level1
?,Ten,???,??,?,-,cross,,This cross is the symbol for the number ten.

Cross = ten, you see?",This cross in particular has ten jewels (???) on it. Two on each arm and two in the middle. That's ten jewels!,"Picture the jewels on this cross.

?,Three,??,?,"?, ?",-,"ground, two",,This kanji is made up of the ground radical (which also happens to be the kanji for "one") and the radical for two. Combine one and two together and what do you get? Three!,"This one should be pretty self explanatory! Even easier, you can look at this kanji and see it has three straight lines. You know what one looks like. You know what two looks like. So... this is three!","Three is the number of chances you get with Santa-san (??). He has a list, and when you get to three ""naughty things"" lines, that's it. You're on Santa-san's three strikes and you're out list.","Picture Santa-san sitting at his desk at the North Pole, eating cookies, and marking one, two, then finally three lines next to names.

?,Two,?,??,?,-,two,,"The kanji two and the radical two are the exact same things.

It's two lines, that's not all that hard to remember!","Think of all the things you have Two of. What is the most important? Some would say eyes, some would say ears. I would say the knee (?) because if you didn't have them, it'd be really hard to go up stairs.","Imagine yourself without two knees, and see what it would be like. What would give you trouble? What couldn't you do? Just imagining this for a minute or two will help you to remember the reading of this kanji more effectively.",43,level1 kanji
?,Woman,??,"???, ?",?,-,woman,,The radical for woman and the kanji for woman are exactly the same.,"That means if you know your radicals well, you know the meaning of this kanji as well! How swell.","When you think of a woman, think of Jo-Anne (??), though she usually goes by just ""Jo.""","Whenever the reading ?? comes up, we will use the character Jo-Anne.

?,Again,-,??,?,-,stool,,You're sitting on your stool again!!?,"There's someone you know who carries a stool around with her all the time. Why? Because she's super pregnant and can't walk too far. You're walking with her, but she has to stop every few feet and sit on her stool, again and again. Feel irritated about this, because it will help you to remember the meaning of this kanji better.

Where are you two going? Where would a super preggers person go? Well, she needs to go to the matanity (??) store to get new clothes for her giant baby stomach.","I know ""mata"" and ""maternity"" are a bit of a stretch, but the goal is to get you to the memory of ?? in your head, so they don't necessarily need to be exactly the same.

May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while. When you think about a circle, think about Maru all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it. Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to ""Maru.""","Obviously if you ""don't know this reading"" well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos.
