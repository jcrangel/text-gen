Could you do it? Try again, this time in thirty seconds. Did you do it again? Okay, go ahead and move on. You may know it now, though you'll need to recall it again in the next 5-10 minutes if you want to remember it for good. Alternatively, if you know the reading for the vocab word ??

It has the same meaning, though it is a word for describing. Words that end with ? are often adjectives, remember that for future words as well. So, as long as you know the meaning of this kanji, you can transfer that to the meaning of this word. It's the adjective big / large.","What do you do when you see something really, really big?

You have eight yachts (???). Go ahead and count them. They're beautiful. Also, be sure not to be confused by this particular reading mnemonic.

This reading comes from the word ???. If you know that word already, this one will be easy. If not, then you'll have to think that the entrance you're going in is eerie (??). Then, because this word is really two separate words put together to form one word, you can guess that ? also uses the kun'yomi reading, though the ? in ?? changes to ? due to something called rendaku.

In English the ""Mount(ain)"" part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender ??, ???, and so on. You can add ? to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji.","Normally ?? would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji.

This means you know it's an adjective. What is the adjective form of few? It's also few.","The reading for this one is fairly difficult, as it's the kun'yomi reading (you can tell it's kun'yomi because of all the hiragana attached). You have to remember the ?? part to remember the reading of this word. Think of it this way: You have a few of something. This something is suckers (??).

That means you can usually guess it's a noun, adverb or na-adjective (in this case it's a noun / adverb). The meaning of this word is pretty much the same as the kanji, though, making it fairly easy. The kanji meaning for ? is few, and the meaning of the vocab form is a little or a few.",Did you know that this word created an English word you probably already know?

It's the word for ""America."" You know that ? means ""person,"" so you can figure out that America + Person = American.","Often times when two kanji come together to form a combo kanji you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. So, the reading of ? is the on'yomi reading ??, which you learned already in the kanji.

This word is literally "door mouth" but I bet you can figure out that this actually means doorway.,"The reading for this one is mixed. You get the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, even though it's a combo (jukugo) kanji. Since ?'s only reading is the kun'yomi reading you should know it. Also, you should know the kun'yomi reading for ? as well from level 1. That means as long as you remember that this is a kun'yomi fest over here, you should be able to read this word.

If you need to talk about someone's father that you don't really know, or you aren't close to, you'll want to use ???, instead. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, ?????. Kay?","The part you have to learn to read is the ? portion. This uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn when doing the kanji.

This word is fairly common, though it's not super polite, either. It's okay most of the time, but it can be used derogatorily depending on the situation. The more polite version is ??? (outside country person) but you won't learn that until you learn the kanji for ?.","This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

?,"Fresh, Raw",??,"Noun, Prefix, and ? adjective",????????????,I made ganache.,????????????,I don't like raw veggies.,??????????????,Give me a draft beer!,"Normally a single kanji alone like this would mean the same thing as its parent kanji, but in the case of ? it's a little different (but still related).

That's why you eat it when it's fresh, and that's also when you eat it raw. You'll see this word at the beginning of other words. For example, ???? is ""raw egg.""","This uses one of the kun'yomi readings.
