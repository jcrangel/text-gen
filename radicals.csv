Barb,亅,"This radical is shaped like a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>barb</b></font>, like you'd see on barb wire, or something. Imagine one of these getting stuck in your arm, and think about how much it would hurt to pull it out with that hook on the end. Say out loud 'Oh dang... I got this barb stuck in me.'",level1 radical
Big,大,"This radical looks just like a stick figure - more specifically, a really <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>big</b></font> dude stick figure. When you see this radical, just think big because this guy is really <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>BIG</b></font>!",level1 radical
Construction,工,"You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those - they have a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>construction</b></font>. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!",level1 radical
Cross,十,"This radical looks like a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>cross</b></font>. Think about Jews carrying these crosses. Technically Jews don't carry crosses usually, but it will help you to think of this because of the kanji version of this coming up later.",level1 radical
Drop,丶,"This is a small radical, just a little dash. This little dash is a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>drop</b></font> (of liquid, or something else). Remember, it's just a single drop, there will be other radicals that consist of multiple drops that mean other things, so it's important to remember this one properly (as just one drop!)",level1 radical
Enclosure,勹,"This radical encloses a lot of things (or at least tries to enclose things). It's like a big latchy box that goes around something and then chomps down to enclose it, making this the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>enclosure</b></font> radical. Imagine something like this trying to come down from the sky to enclose you. Scary looking, right?",level1 radical
Enter,入,"Be careful, this radical looks a lot like the 'person' radical (人). What's the difference? It has something extra sticking out the top, off to the side. When you look at this radical, though, I bet you can see how it looks like a tee-pee. The top is tied up and there's sticks overlapping each other up there. Then, the tent part comes down to the ground. This particular tee-pee, however, has a huge gaping entrance in it. So, what do you do? You <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>enter</b></font> it.",level1 radical
Fins,ハ,"Human legs look like this radical (儿) because we have feet. Even animals have feet, too. But, this radical doesn't have any feet, just little things sticking out. That's why these are fish <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>fins</b></font>. They're sticking out the side of the fish (just imagine a fish in the middle of those fins, then have it flap them around). That's why this radical means 'fins' and not 'legs.'",level1 radical
Ground,一,"This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>ground</b></font>. Look at the ground, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?",level1 radical
Gun,𠂉,"Doesn't this look a bit like a gun? You have a shoulder rest and the barrel. Bam bam bam! Another way to look at it would be to see it as a handgun, where the shoulder rest is the handle of the handgun and you're holding it that way. Either way, you should arrive at the same conclusion. This radical is a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>gun</b></font>.",level1 radical
Leaf,丆 (⿱一丶),"There's a stem at the bottom and the leaf at the top, making this the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>leaf</b></font> radical. It kind of looks like one of those giant pond leaves, don't you think?",level1 radical
Lid,亠,"This looks just like something you'd put on a kettle, right? Even a little handle to make sure you don't burn yourself. This radical is some kind of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>lid</b></font>.",level1 radical
Mountain,山,"This is a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>mountain</b></font> - you'll have to add the lines that make up the roof of the mountain, though, if you want it more 'mountain-like.' Also something that might help: sometimes mountains have a couple of smaller peaks coming out the side of the main peak, too. Connect the dots and create the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>mountain</b></font> in your mind.",level1 radical
Mouth,口,A big gaping square hole represents someone opening their giant <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>mouth</b></font> to tell you something stupid.,level1 radical
Nine,九,"If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters 'n' and 'i' (the 'i' comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters 'n' and 'i' start spelling? Why, the word <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>nine</b></font>.",level1 radical
Person,人,"If you were to draw a person with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: 大. This, however, is just the legs... but why is it just the legs? This stick figure is a  zombie stick figure. It comes at you, and you push it away, but when you do, the whole top half gets torn away. He looks up and says 'Hey, I'm a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>person</b></font> too, you know. Why'd you have to do that?'",level1 radical
Power,力,Imagine a guy flexing his arm downward to show off his steroid-pumped arm. It's huge. It's so full of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>power</b></font>. RARRRWWWRRR!!,level1 radical
River,川,"This radical already looks like a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>river</b></font>. See the banks of the river on the side and the flow of the river in the middle? There's even a slight turn in the river, too. So, when you see this radical, you should think 'river.'",level1 radical
Seven,七,"What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>seven</b></font>, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning of this radical!",level1 radical
Slide,丿,When we say '<font color='#0a9ce6'><b>slide</b></font>' we're talking about the kind you sit on and slide down. It's shaped just like one. Imagine a little version of yourself sliding down this slide and having a great time. Imagination + emotion makes for good memorization!,level1 radical
Stick,丨,"This is a single <font color=""#0a9ce6""><b>stick</b></font>, standing upright. It even looks like a <font color=""#0a9ce6""><b>stick</b></font>. The <font color=""#0a9ce6""><b>stick</b></font> is standing up straight because it can stick out of the ground (radical), which is why it's vertical. So, when you see this stick sticking in the ground, just think 'stick.'<br />",level1 radical
Sun,日,"Since there are no circles in Japanese characters, sometimes rectangles or squares have to make do. In this case, this big rectangle is the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>sun</b></font>. The middle line going through the center horizontally is the equator line. Imagine the sun as a big rectangle in the sky with a line through it and think about how weird that is - if you think it's weird enough in your mind, you'll probably remember this radical as well!",level1 radical
Toe,ト,"This radical looks just like the katakana ト (to) character, which sounds like the word <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>toe</b></font>. So, when you see ト think <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>toe</b></font>.",level1 radical
Tree,木,"Do you see the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>tree</b></font> in here? It has branches, and then it has the foliage coming down diagonally from it, spreading out like a tree would. That's why this radical is a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>tree</b></font>.",level1 radical
Two,二,"One line plus another line equals <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>two</b></font> lines. This radical represents the number <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>two</b></font>. Pretty simple, right? Can you guess what three looks like? I bet you can...",level1 radical
Woman,女,"This radical looks like two stacked X's, one on top of the other. When it comes to chromosomes, males = xy and females = xx. therefore, this radical means <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>woman</b></font>.",level1 radical
Child,子,"This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, who (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>child</b></font> to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.",level2 radical
Cow,牛,"There's a cross and a gun, with the gun going through the cross. You're using the cross to stabilize your gun, because you need to shoot a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>cow</b></font> for dinner. The reason you bring your cross is because you need to bless the cow once you've killed it (and it's also a good stand for your gun). Poor cow.",level2 radical
Dog,犬,"Remember the 'big guy' that helped you to remember the 'big' radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look, and see that he has a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>dog</b></font> up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that. How strange.",level2 radical
Doll,文,"Doesn't this look like a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>doll</b></font>? It has a head, arms, legs, and a body! So pretty.",level2 radical
Evening,夕,"Do you see the enclosure and drop radicals as a part of this radical? This enclosure is holding on to a drop because it's the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>evening</b></font>. Evening air does a better job holding on to drops of liquid like this, which is why everything is covered in dew in the morning.",level2 radical
Eye,目,"See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Be sure to remember how in kanji there are no round things, so square things take their place. So, the rectangle shaped outline could be more rounded, and the middle more rounded as well. If it was like that, this radical would look an awful lot like an <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>eye</b></font>.",level2 radical
Fire,火,See the person radical here? It's got things coming off of it... what are those things OH MY GOD IT'S <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>FIRE</b></font>!!! Why is there fire on that person??,level2 radical
Five,五,"If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number '5.' You have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, but once you do that, you have an easy way to memorize that this radical means <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>five</b></font>.",level2 radical
Flag,尸,"See the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>flag</b></font> in this radical? There's a pole with a flag on the end of it, blowing in the wind. Basically, this radical looks just like a flag.",level2 radical
Grave,土,"There's a cross in the ground, which makes this a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>grave</b></font>. Now, later on you'll learn a really similar radical with a cross that's wider than the ground. Just remember, this is a regular ol' grave, where the cross is not as wide as the ground.",level2 radical
Hair,彡,"These three streaks flowing off to the side are three strands of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>hair</b></font>. Pretty easy to see and remember, right?",level2 radical
Hand,手,"This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So, you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>hand</b></font>.",level2 radical
Head,冂,"This is the kind of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>head</b></font> a child might draw - can you imagine it with eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, too? Whoever's head this is, it's really square and strange looking. All the better for you to remember this radical, though!",level2 radical
Heaven,天,"There is a 'two' radical and a 'person' radical. The first level of a person's life is earth. The second level (this level, which is why there's a 'two' radical here) is <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>heaven</b></font>. So, when you see a person at level 2, you know they're in heaven.",level2 radical
King,王,This strange radical / symbol is not something anyone can have. Only a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>king</b></font> can wear this crown upon his head. This radical is the sign of kings. Imagine your favorite king wearing this on their head. It's a pretty distinctive shape/pattern - I think you can do it.,level2 radical
Legs,儿,"This radical already looks like a pair of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>legs</b></font>. There's even feet on these legs (unlike the fins radical, which you learned earlier). That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else).",level2 radical
Lion,L,"This L-Shaped Radical is the radical <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>lion</b></font>, because 'L is for Lion.' You'll have to remember two steps for this one. You'll see that it's an 'L,' then you have to remember what 'L' stands for. I think 'Lion' is one of the first things that comes to mind, and it'll make for interesting mnemonics, which is why this radical is <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>lion</b></font>.",level2 radical
Middle,中,"There's a stick going right through the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>middle</b></font> of someone's mouth! Imagine that mouth being yours. Measure the placement of the stick. Perfectly aligned right in the middle. That's amazing, though to be honest, you probably have bigger problems than measuring the location of this stick in your mouth.",level2 radical
Moon,月,"The <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>moon</b></font> is actually made of the sun, but it has streamers coming off of it leaning towards the left. Why? because the moon is always running away from the sun as fast as it can. It wouldn't want to get caught by the fire of the sun, after all!",level2 radical
Nail,丁,"See the barb radical with a head on it? It looks just like a nail. That barb on the end looks painful. Imagine getting that nailed into your arm, with someone hitting the head of this nail with a big hammer. Imagine how much it would hurt to pull out, too. No, really, imagine it - it will help you to remember this radical so much better. Thwack Thwack Thwack!",level2 radical
Narwhal,ナ,"This radical looks like the katakana character 'na' (ナ) which we're going to say stands for <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>narwhal</b></font>. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (ナ) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (メ), like an 'X.'",level2 radical
Pile,ム,This little triangle isn't quite a triangle because it's not one single thing. It's several things put together to form a little <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>pile</b></font> of something.,level2 radical
Real,本,"With all the fake things in this world, it's sometimes nice to get something that comes out of the ground, like a tree. Things like this are <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>real</b></font>, not fake like plastic, etc.",level2 radical
Rice Paddy,田,Rice paddies are made up of fields with irrigation going between them. See the four rice paddies with water going between them and around them? That's why this radical is <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>rice paddy</b></font>.,level2 radical
Small,小,"Inside this radical, you have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>small</b></font>, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.",level2 radical
Spring,弓,"Boing, boing, boing. This looks just like a giant <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>spring</b></font> that you might put on the bottom of your shoes to jump higher.",level2 radical
Stand,立,"Two sticks are propping up the lid. By doing this, you are making it <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>stand</b></font> up.",level2 radical
Stone,石,"There's a leaf growing out of a square thing (which is normally a mouth, but not this time). You should think this is odd, because the leaf is growing out of a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>stone</b></font>, and leaves don't normally grow out of stones.",level2 radical
Stool,又,"This looks just like a fold-out <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>stool</b></font>, amiright?",level2 radical
Stop,止,"There's a giant toe and a stick in the ground in front of you. You're driving your car towards them, and don't see them until your lights hit them. What would these things cause you to do? Most likely <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>stop</b></font> your car right away.",level2 radical
Sword,刀,"If you look at this radical, it looks like the bottom part of a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>sword</b></font> - the handle, more specifically. This radical also looks a lot like the power radical (力), so don't get confused. It's missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword radical is 90% of the power radical).",level2 radical
Thousand,千,"You're in a room, surrounded by <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>slides</b></font>. Out of the slides are tumbling <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>cross</b></font> after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... Each cross has a number called out. 'ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED!' and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE <font color='#e20096'><b>THOUSAND</b></font> and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breath.",level2 radical
Treasure,メ,"This radical is <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>treasure</b></font> because 'X marks the spot' as they say. Don't confuse this radical with Narwhal (ナ). This one looks more like an X, which is where the treasure is.",level2 radical
Water,水,"There's drops of liquid coming out of both sides of the barb. You can imagine this barb being stuck into the ground then pulled out. When it is, <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>water</b></font> comes gushing out on both sides of it!",level2 radical
White,白,"You apply a small drop of magic liquid to the sun, and it causes it to turn <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>white</b></font>! This is a terrible thing, you realize, because in actuality, you just made the sun way, way hotter, melting everyone on earth. Maybe if you applied another drop it wouldn't be white hot anymore...?",level2 radical
Antennae,干,Doesn't this look like the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>antennae</b></font> that would be on top of a house or maybe on top of a television? That's why this radical means 'antennae.',level3 radical
Arrow,矢,"You have a slide coming down from heaven with this radical. You are using a slide to get out of heaven because you're escaping. As you try to escape, angels are shooting at you with <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>arrows</b></font>. You get hit by an <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>arrow</b></font> and it goes right through your arm. Grab your arm and think about how much these heaven arrows hurt!",level3 radical
Direction,方,This radical looks like a dude running off to the right. He's heading in a very distinct <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>direction</b></font>. Which direction was it again?,level3 radical
Door,戸,"Where does a flag usually go? It goes over a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>door</b></font>. I know the 一 radical usually means ground, but in this case we're going to say the flag is in the doorway (where the 一 is the top of the door).",level3 radical
Drawer,母,See the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>drawer</b></font>? It has two shelves in it with a little nubbin handle on each to let you pull them out. Imagine using this drawer - it'd be pretty oddly shaped.,level3 radical
Elephant,用,"This radical is made up of two moon radicals stuck together. Two moons stuck together would be something huge - in this case, that huge thing is an <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>elephant</b></font>. In fact, if you look at the radical itself, it looks like the profile of an elephant, with its trunk on the right side and its legs in the middle and back!",level3 radical
Father,父,"There's fins covering the treasure making up this radical. You pull away the fins and start digging where the X (because 'X' marks where the treasure is, right?). When you dig down, instead of finding treasure, you find your <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>father</b></font>. The shock of this in your imagination should help you to remember the meaning of this radical!",level3 radical
Fur,毛,"Do you remember the 'hair' radical? This is like that, except now the hair is attached to a tail. Animals don't usually have hair, though. Instead, they have <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>fur</b></font>.",level3 radical
Hat,𠆢,Do you know those rice paddy hats? The ones shaped just like this radical? That's why this radical is a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>hat</b></font>.,level3 radical
Heart,心,"Take a good look at this one. It kind of looks like a heart (not the stereotypical Valentine’s Day heart, though). Think of a real heart. Basically, there’s a lump (the heart) in the middle, and three lines which make up the veins that go in and out of the heart to keep you alive. This kanji / radical does show up quite often, though, so it shouldn’t be too hard to learn as you go along, too. Remember, lump (heart) plus veins equals a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>heart</b></font>… like, a real heart, not the fake pretty kind.",level3 radical
Life,生,"This radical consists of a cow radical with the ground radical below it. If you have cows on solid ground, then you really do have a good <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>life</b></font>, I think. Sometimes this radical will show up without the slide part on the side too, though we'll treat them both as 'life.'",level3 radical
Mullet,广,"It's a party in the back and business in the front. It's a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>mullet</b></font>. You can see the short hair(s) on top, even, and the long, sweeping beauty in the back. This is the best haircut in the world. This is a mullet.",level3 radical
Nailbat,扌,"This barb has two things sticking through it. This looks like a devastating weapon. Why, it looks like a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>nailbat</b></font>, actually!",level3 radical
Old,古,"You have a cross on a mouth - who speaks the most about religion? <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>Old</b></font> people, mostly. Also, think the teachings of religion itself - also pretty <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>old</b></font>, age-wise. No matter how you look at it, everything about this radical is kind of 'old.'",level3 radical
Origin,元,"You have 'two' and 'legs' making up this radical. Between two legs is where you came from, no matter how you look at it. These two legs are your <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>origin</b></font>.",level3 radical
Poop,幺,"You have the pile radical (ム), then you have something that's taller (this one). The taller pile is a little grosser. Why? Because it's a stinking pile of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>poop</b></font>. We can only hope it's not human...",level3 radical
Ra,ラ,"This radical looks just like the katakana character 'ra' (ラ). The sound 'ra' sounds just like the famous Egyptian God 'Ra' as well, so we're going to say this radical represents Egypt's God <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>Ra</b></font>.",level3 radical
Raptor Cage,久,This is no ordinary enclosure. It is an enclosure with an extra reinforcement (see it sticking out the bottom right of the enclosure radical?). Why is this enclosure reinforced? Because it's the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>raptor cage</b></font>. I wonder how long they'll be able to hold the raptors... It didn't work out all that well on Jurassic Park...,level3 radical
Spoon,ヒ,"This radical looks like a child, sitting up, with no head, reaching its arm out for you. It wants only one thing, a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>spoon</b></font> so it can eat its pudding, which it just dumps down its neck. Try to take the spoon away from the decapitated child... unfortunately you can't, because it's too strong (zombification has already taken effect!)",level3 radical
Triceratops,⺌ (⺍),"The three horns represent the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>triceratops</b></font>, one of the most awesome dinosaurs ever.",level3 radical
Winter,夂,"This looks like a stool radical, but something is wrong. If you sat on this stool, you might slip right off because of that slanted bit. Why is the stool so slippery? Because it's covered in ice because it is currently <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>winter</b></font>.",level3 radical
Alligator,也,"See the mouth and teeth of this <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>alligator</b></font>, which is facing to the right? You wouldn't want to get your hand stuck in there, that's for sure.",level4 radical
Bamboo,竹,See how tall the stalks are with little bushy things at the top? It kind of looks like <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>bamboo</b></font> if you use your imagination a bit.,level4 radical
Bed,巴,"You'll have to complete the line on the right side in your mind, but see the rectangle <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>bed</b></font> and the pillows? This is totally a 'bed.'",level4 radical
Beggar,丂,"Doesn't this look like someone on their knees, holding their hands out (clasped) and begging for something (money, their life, etc.)? That's why this radical is known as the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>beggar</b></font>.",level4 radical
Car,車,Doesn't this look like a top-down view of the frame of a car? There's the rods that make up the base of the car and things for the wheels to go on. That's why this radical is the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>car</b></font> radical.,level4 radical
Ceremony,弋,"This radical looks like a guy standing on one foot (because you only see one leg) holding onto something that produces drops of liquid. This person is pretty drunk, apparently. It's because he's performing the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>ceremony</b></font> of drinking lots and lots.",level4 radical
"Clam, shell",貝,"There's a giant eye on top of some fins. Imagine this giant eye to be on top of a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>clam</b></font>. It has little fins on which it runs around on, escaping from your every attempt to capture it.",level4 radical
Cliff,厂,See the cliff? It's facing towards the west. What ocean is to your west? That's the direction this <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>cliff</b></font> is facing.,level4 radical
Ear,耳,"A bit more elaborate than the <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>eye</b></font>, though similar. In fact, if you go blind, your <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>ears</b></font> become one of your new senses of sight, which is why this is like another, somewhat modified, eye. You'll even notice little lines sticking out of the eye, that's because ears stick out more than eyes (目), which is why this radical is the ear radical.",level4 radical
Energy,气,"This radical is shaped kind of like a dam. See the wall and the water pushing over the top? If this radical is a dam, then it must create a ton of <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>energy</b></font> as well!",level4 radical
Flowers,艹,"See the little things sticking out of the ground? Those little things are pretty little <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>flowers</b></font>. You know they're flowers and not, say, grass, because they're pretty spaced out. You'll learn grass later, and it will be less spaced out, but somewhat similar to this, so keep that in mind!",level4 radical
Foot,足,Do you see the dude doing a flying dragon kick (or something) to the right? What does he hit the target with? Obviously it's his <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>foot</b></font>.,level4 radical
Forehead,冖,"Sure, this <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>forehead</b></font> is a bit square, but that's because it's Frankenstein's Monster's forehead. Also, did you notice that this is just the top part of the head (冂) radical? This is just the forehead part of that!",level4 radical
Frog,支,"Do you remember / know of the game 'Frogger'? Looking from a bird's eye view, this radical looks just like a <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>frog</b></font>, running across the highway.",level4 radical
Generation,世,"If you look at this radical, you'll notice that the inner piece built onto the ground radical and the outer piece, also built onto the ground are kind of the same... except, the outer piece isn't completely finished yet. The middle bit is all done, and they're the center. The second layer currently being formed is the next <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>generation</b></font>.

Leader,ｲ,"This radical technically means 'person' (like 人), but we're going to shift the meaning a little bit.

He’s balancing a single drop of water on top of his head, and it isn’t breaking (think sphere). He is totally the master… even better than a king.",level4 radical
Measurement,寸,"You have a drop radical and a sort of deformed cross radical. When the cross gets wet, it gets all bent out of shape (like in this radical) so it won't fit in the cross holder.

Samurai,士,"The <font color='#0a9ce6'><b>samurai</b></font> looks a lot like the grave radical. The difference is the top horizontal line. For samurai, the top horizontal line is longer because they're higher class. therefore their gravestone crosses are longer than regular graves, making this radical the samurai radical.",level4 radical
